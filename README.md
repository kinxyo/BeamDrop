# BeamDrop

This is the Rust version of it.

As of yet, based on my experience, I feel Go is only good for creating APIs when using at backend. Like for example, I was creating a Movie Recommended System using Flask. I felt, it could have been much faster and simpler using Go, would love to use Go there. However, when creating \[this] a webapp for file-transfer between devices just like `Airdrop`,  I really felt I should have made this in Rust instead.
Rust is perfect here because I'm more comfortable in it, and it's also more secure and tight (like Go doesn't have even enums, you have to make `const` AND the error handling in Go is also poor).
